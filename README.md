# Stress-and-Applied-Elasticity
Stress and applied elasticity (ME300) midterm project 

Overall idea: Use computational methods to do two-dimensional stress analysis.

Given:  Infinite plate with a circular hole of radius a. 
        \sigma_e = von Mises yield condition, s = applied distributed load
        
Task 1: Plot \frac{\sigma_e}{s} vs. \frac{r}{a} for 1<\frac{r}{a}<4, \theta=0,30,60,90.
        Include the four curves on one graph.
        
Task 2: Draw the contour plot of the equivilant stress normalized by s over the region -4<\frac{x}{a}<4, -4<\frac{y}{a}<4, 1<\frac{r}{a}.

Task 3: Search for the maximum value of \frac{\sigma_e}{s}.

Task 4: Find the critical region where plastification will occur first and the maximum value of \frac{\sigma_e}{s}.
